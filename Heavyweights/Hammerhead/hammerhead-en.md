# 📜 Hammerhead – Champion Entry (English – London)

**Role**: Juggernaut (Jungle)  
**Affiliation**: Core of Endurance  
**Title**: The Silent Bastion

Hammerhead is not a war machine. He is a memory. A remnant. A sacred titan forged before time lost meaning.

Alongside his twin, **Hammerhand**, he stood guard over his homeworld — a place ravaged by an energetic plague that threatened to consume not only his people, but the entire galaxy. Their resistance became legend. But even legends are not immune to erosion.

It was in the dark hour that **Frey** and **Freya**, twin sovereigns of the Tournament, summoned them to Valhalla Rising. In doing so, the plague ceased its expansion — as if the cosmos itself took a breath.

Hammerhead does not crave battle. He despises it. He acts when needed, with method, not malice. His essence was a gift from celestial beings who later fell to madness, abandoning the core of creation.

> *"When gods lose their way, creation bleeds. We were built to mend what breaks."*
