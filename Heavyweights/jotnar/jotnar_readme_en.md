Lore (English):
Forged in the icy depths of Jötunheim, Jotnar is the son of the primordial giant Ymir. Unlike his father, he rejected brutality and sought harmony. He became close to Frey, and was respected by Freya, Jord, and Frigga — one of the few giants accepted by the gods of Asgard.

Odin tasked Jotnar with kidnapping the goddess Aphrodite from Mount Olympus, believing that only love could counter Loki’s hatred and the oncoming Ragnarok. But Jotnar, instead of abducting her, humbly requested her help. He asked Zeus for an audience, respected divine order, and showed honor and strategy.

Hercules refused to fight him. Aphrodite, touched by his nobility, chose to join him and help save the Nine Realms. Along the journey, they fell in love.

Odin rejected their union. Zeus threatened war. Frey and Freya intervened and invited the couple to the Valhalla Rising – The Parchment tournament, where they would fight for justice.

Jotnar took his place as a Juggernaut support, not to conquer — but to protect what he loves.
