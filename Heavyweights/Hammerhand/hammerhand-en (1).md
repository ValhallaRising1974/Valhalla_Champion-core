# 📜 Hammerhand – Champion Entry (English – London)

**Role**: Juggernaut (Jungle)  
**Affiliation**: Core of Endurance  
**Title**: The Unyielding Construct

Hammerhand does not speak. He does not blink. He does not remember.

He is forged — not born. A being of metal, stone, and forgotten vows. His presence on the battlefield is felt long before he appears. The tremor of his steps, the hum of pressure in the air, the silence that precedes impact.

He is not from the Astral Plane. He comes from a world unknown, summoned to Valhalla Rising by **Frey** and **Freya**, twin sovereigns of the Tournament, in hopes of quelling the age-old conflict that once ravaged his realm.

If seen walking through the fog of an old London alley, Hammerhand would not be questioned. He would simply be avoided — like a cathedral that suddenly moved.

He is the twin brother of **Hammerhead**, though none know which one came first.

> *"I do not move for war. War moves because I have moved."*
