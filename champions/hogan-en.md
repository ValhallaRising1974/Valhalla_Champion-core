# 📜 Hogan – Champion Entry (English – London)

**Role**: Sniper  
**Affiliation**: Core of Precision  
**Title**: The Watchful Resolve

Hogan might not speak often, but when he does, time seems to pause.

In the mists of Valhalla's twilight, he would likely be found not on the frontlines, but above them—watching, calculating. Had he lived in London, one might imagine him on a rainy rooftop, coat heavy with fog, eyes trained on the unseen.

He is the husband of **Leila**, and father of **Tuane** and **Lara**. While Leila is the voice of balance, Hogan is its silence—precise, firm, and unshaken.

> *"When the time is right, one shot is enough."*
