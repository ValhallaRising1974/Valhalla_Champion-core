# ðŸ“œ Gretaâ€™s Lore â€“ *Valhalla Rising: The Parchment* (EN)

Greta is the younger sister of Bjorn and a feline-featured Sniper focused on attack speed and area critical damage. Agile, stylish, and dangerous, Greta wields dual submachine guns and wears long high-heeled boots, striking fear into her enemies with speed and unpredictability.

Born on the Planet Astral, Greta has always been known for her reflexes and sharp aim. While her brother Bjorn investigates the mysteries of Valhalla Rising under the guidance of Talos, Greta joins the tournament to protect her brother and prove she is equally worthy.

She thrives on fast ambushes and aggressive plays, making her ideal for quick-thinking players. She plays exclusively in the Firestarter lane.

**Abilities:**
- **Passive â€“ Shot in the Dark**: Each skillshot that hits enemy champions increases her accuracy by 200% and reduces cooldowns by 1 second. Hitting 3 consecutive targets makes her next basic attack deal True Critical Damage.
- **Q â€“ Bullet Storm**: Fires 3 sequences of 3 simultaneous shots, dealing area damage. Hitting different targets increases final damage by 20%.
- **W â€“ Smoke Grenade**: Throws a smoke grenade that blinds and slows enemies for 2.5s. If used during her Ultimate, her hit rate increases by 100%.
- **E â€“ Burst Spray**: Fires in opposite directions, hitting enemies in a wide area. If it kills a target, it resets and deals double damage on the next use.
- **R â€“ Feline Frenzy (Ultimate)**: Fires in 3 directions at once with critical area damage. If more than one enemy is killed, her damage doubles on remaining targets.
