# ðŸ“œ Bjornâ€™s Lore â€“ *Valhalla Rising: The Parchment* (EN)

Bjorn is the older brother of Greta and a unique Sniper on the battlefield: he deals the least damage of all Snipers but excels with the highest mobility and durability. His body is a metallic exoskeleton equipped with dual pistols and reinforced legs, built to withstand ambushes and execute tactical maneuvers.

Though he looks like a machine, Bjorn is fully human. Hailing from the Planet Astral, he served as a guardian soldier and also published an independent journal. To complete his series, he needed data only found in *Valhalla Rising â€“ The Parchment*. Thus, he made a pact with **Talos**, the legendary bronze automaton of Crete.

Talos approached Frey and Freya, rulers of the tournament, and asked for access. They agreed, but only if the knowledge was earned through justice and hard work. Talos then chose Bjorn as his champion.

Bjorn is in love with **Tuane**, a Bruiser from the Middleway lane, daughter of Norabel and Harmenszoon. Tuane shares the feeling, but focuses on self-improvement. Bjorn remains committed to his mission on behalf of Talos.

**Abilities:**
- **Q â€“ Fireflye**: Fires short-range bullets that explode in a flash, causing slow and blindness.
- **W â€“ Boomerang**: Throws his weapons as boomerangs that ricochet, breaking armor and slowing enemies.
- **E â€“ Fast and Furious**: Fires a sequence of 8 straight shots dealing physical damage. If a target is eliminated with any ability, all cooldowns are reset.
- **R â€“ The Final Countdown (Ultimate)**: Unleashes a barrage of bullets. If the target is slain, he instantly reloads.
