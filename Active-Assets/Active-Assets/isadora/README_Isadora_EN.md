# ðŸ“œ Isadoraâ€™s Lore â€“ *Valhalla Rising: The Parchment* (EN)

Isadora is a veteran Sniper in Valhalla Rising â€“ The Parchment. A 40-year-old Black woman with dreadlocks, an athletic body, and striking curves, she is a battle-hardened fighter. Daughter of Warlock Leila and Sniper Hogan, Isadora is sister to Lara and an as-yet-unnamed Warlock of destruction.

Unlike her father, who fights with tactical precision, Isadora takes an aggressive approach. She wears soldierâ€™s gear, torn jeans, combat boots, and a belt filled with bullet cartridges. She wields two powerful Pulmam carbines adapted for versatile, high-impact fire. As a teacher like her mother, Isadora blends intellect and brute force to control the battlefield with cold focus.

She is dedicated to the Firestarter lane. If she is on the same team as her sister Lara, either of them will lose efficiency if they move out of their original lane. If they are on opposite teams, they exchange unique dialogue lines.

**Abilities:**
- **Q â€“ Rotten Alone**: Fires a projectile that bursts into an acid cloud, causing physical damage over time, armor shred, and lifesteal.
- **W â€“ Slowly You Rot**: Fires a 7-shot sequence with lifesteal and slow. Each shot releases a layer of corrosive gas.
- **E â€“ Dodge and Strike**: Dodges and strikes twice with her weapon's butt, dealing damage and stunning the enemy.
- **R â€“ Blast All of Them (Ultimate)**: Switches her carbines into cannon mode and fires 7 armor-piercing long-range shots, dealing massive critical damage.
