# ðŸŽ¯ Isadora â€“ *Valhalla Rising: The Parchment* (EN)

Isadora is a veteran Sniper in *Valhalla Rising â€“ The Parchment*. Daughter of Warlock Leila and Sniper Hogan, she is the sister of Lara and an unrevealed damage Warlock.

Unlike her father's tactical style, Isadora fights with more aggression and impact. She wears rugged combat gear: ripped jeans, boots, and a belt filled with ammo. She wields two heavy-duty Pulmam carbines.

In addition to being a Sniper, she is also a teacher, like her mother. She combines wisdom and strength to dominate the battlefield with confidence and intensity.

She plays exclusively in the **Firestarter** lane. When on the same team as Lara, either one loses efficiency if taken out of their original lane. On opposite sides, they interact with unique dialogue.

**Abilities:**
- **Q â€“ Rotten Alone**: Fires a projectile that explodes into an acid cloud, dealing continuous physical damage, armor break, and life steal.
- **W â€“ Slowly You Rot**: Fires a sequence of 7 shots with life steal and slow. Each hit releases a layer of corrosive gas.
- **E â€“ Dodge and Strike**: Dodges and strikes twice with the butt of her weapon, causing damage and stun.
- **R â€“ Blast All of Them (Ultimate)**: Switches to cannon mode and fires 7 long-range piercing projectiles with massive critical damage.
