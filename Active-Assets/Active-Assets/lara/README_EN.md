# ðŸ“œ Laraâ€™s Lore â€“ *Valhalla Rising: The Parchment* (EN)

Lara is the youngest daughter of Hogan and Leila, sister to Sniper Isadora and a yet-to-be-revealed Warlock of destruction. She was born on the Planet Astral, a place of harmony, knowledge, and emotional strength. From a young age, she displayed exceptional athletic talent and a boundless curiosity, often creating comic books where she imagined herself as a semi-human feline heroine â€” a form she eventually embraced to join *Valhalla Rising â€“ The Parchment*.

Aware that her parents had been summoned to the tournament by Frey and Freya, Lara sought her own path by forging a pact with the **Norns** â€” Urd, Verdandi, and Skuld â€” the Nordic entities who weave the fate of gods and mortals. The pact allowed her to fight alongside her family as a Firestarter Sniper.

Lara is a prodigy with the soul of an artist and the instincts of a warrior. Like her sister Isadora, an Olympic-level athlete and teacher like their mother, Lara was trained by their father in sharpshooting. Both sisters share the same battlefield role and possess a strong bond. When they fight on opposing teams, they exchange unique dialogue. If on the same team, however, either will lose effectiveness if they are placed outside the Firestarter lane.
