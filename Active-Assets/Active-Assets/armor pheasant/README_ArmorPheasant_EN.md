# ðŸ“œ Armor Pheasantâ€™s Lore â€“ *Valhalla Rising: The Parchment* (EN)

Armor Pheasant, the Golden Pheasant, is the youngest brother of Warlocks Ariel and Turquey. While his siblings rely on arcane power, Pheasant chose the path of calculated marksmanship. His body is a hybrid between a vibrant pheasant and a humanoid form, equipped with powerful guns mounted on his wings and enhanced eyesight.

Trained on Planet Cisco to be an elite warrior, Pheasant developed his own combat style. Agile and precise, he uses aerial mobility and ranged techniques to dominate the battlefield. Like all Snipers, he uses **Vigor** as his resource and operates exclusively in the **Firestarter** lane.

Despite his flamboyant appearance, Pheasant is quiet and strategic, with a sharp mind and deadly accuracy. His purpose in Valhalla Rising â€“ The Parchment is to honor his people and fight for harmony between physical and mystical powers.

**Abilities:**
- **Q â€“ QuickShot**: Fires a sequence of 10 ultra-fast shots, dealing physical damage over time.
- **W â€“ Pen and Fire**: Unleashes 8 razor feathers and 8 bullets from his wings, slowing enemies and dealing mixed damage over time.
- **E â€“ Skyburst**: Flies vertically and drops concussion grenades from above, dealing area damage and penetrating armor.
- **R â€“ Golden Pheasant (Ultimate)**: Turns into a golden arrow in pheasant form and fires a blazing ray in a straight line, dealing fire damage and slow.
