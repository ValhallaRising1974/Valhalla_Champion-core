# 📜 Leila – Champion Entry (English – London)

**Role**: Warlock  
**Affiliation**: Core of Balance  
**Title**: The Teacher of Redemption

Leila is a noble Warlock whose presence feels like a quiet force of wisdom. Had one encountered her in the Astral sanctuaries of Valhalla, they might have been inclined to believe she should be addressed as a guardian of fate itself.

She might very well be perceived, in the courts of London, as someone who could wield silence as both shield and spear. Her aura would certainly have to be noticed — an echo of those who ought to lead with intellect and justice.

She is married to **Hogan**, a seasoned Sniper known for his discipline and observation. Together, they have raised **Tuane** (a Bruiser) and **Lara** (a Sniper), both of whom must have inherited Leila's sense of clarity and internal power.

Leila should not be mistaken for a sorcerer of destruction. Rather, she would be inclined to restore, to realign.
