Lore (English):
Born from sea foam and the passion of the ancient titans, Aphrodite was more than a goddess of beauty — she was the living essence of love, tenderness, and true desire. For ages, she lived among the gods of Olympus, witnessing wars, alliances, and betrayals, but always refused to be a tool for war.

Then came Jotnar, the frost giant from Jötunheim, who walked into the marble halls of Olympus. Sent by Odin to kidnap Aphrodite and force her to spread love across the Nine Realms, Jotnar shocked the gods by rejecting violence and instead requesting an audience with Zeus.

With calm words and noble posture, Jotnar explained:
“Loki’s hatred corrupts the roots of Yggdrasil. Ragnarok is coming, and Odin... he cannot stop it, only delay it. But you, Aphrodite, with your essence... can restore peace where the gods have failed.”

Zeus laughed. Hera demanded his execution. Hercules, ordered to expel Jotnar, felt the giant’s honor and refused to fight.
It was Aphrodite who stepped forward:
“You could have taken me by force, as many have before. But you came with honor... and asked for my help. That is true love. And where there is love, I will go.”

She left with Jotnar, journeying through Yggdrasil’s realms, calming hearts and healing ancient wounds. Along the way, the two fell in love. A forbidden love. A profound love.

But Odin, still trapped in pride, refused to accept Aphrodite in Asgard.
Zeus, resentful, threatened war for losing his goddess.
Frey and Freya intervened — and invited the couple to join a new battlefield:
Valhalla Rising – The Parchment.

There, Aphrodite embraced her new role. Not just as a goddess, but as a fighter.
A Warlock of Damage, wielding love as a weapon, seduction as her shield, and freedom as her path.
She does not fight to harm. She fights to heal what the gods have broken.

And beside Jotnar, she became a beacon in the dark — a star that shines, not for the gods...
But for all who still believe in love.
