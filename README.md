##  Key Concepts

- **Champions** are more than characters. They are symbolic beings.
- Each one has:
  - Health (vitality)
  - Mana (spiritual energy)
  - Contextual speech (`speak()` method)
  - Unique combat mechanics

This structure allows deep narrative integration and emotional resonance, far beyond typical game mechanics.

## How to Run

Make sure you have Java installed, then compile and run:

```bash
javac core/ValhallaChampion.java champions/Leila.java champions/Tuane.java test/Main.java
java -cp . test.Main
```

---

## Example Test

The `Main.java` file simulates a turn-based combat between two champions with printed dialogue, attack, and ultimate abilities.
