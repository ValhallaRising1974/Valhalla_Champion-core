# Devlog #2 – Symbolism in the Map: Not Just Paths  
*March 26, 2025*

When I designed the map for Valhalla Rising – The Parchment, I wasn’t only placing lanes and obelisks.

I was creating a metaphor.

Each path — Highland, The Middle Way, Firestarter — represents more than strategic choices. They reflect how we move through life.

- **Highland** is the path of vision and solitude.  
  It’s where those who carry burdens silently walk — aiming for clarity above the noise.

- **The Middle Way** is the path of logic and conflict.  
  It’s where balance is tested, truths are challenged, and illusions fall.

- **Firestarter** is the path of instinct and raw force.  
  It’s emotion, trauma, rebellion — the path I’ve walked many times without knowing its name.

And then, there are the **Obelisks** — anchors between realities.  
They stand like echoes of memories, asking: *Do you still remember why you fight?*

This map is not flat.  
It floats.  
Like us — in the cosmos, in thought, in emotion.

This is more than a battlefield.  
It’s a mirror.  
And now, it's part of me.
