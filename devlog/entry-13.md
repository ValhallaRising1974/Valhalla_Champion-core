# Devlog #13 – When the Map Began to Breathe  
*March 27, 2025*

At first, it was just a sketch.

Lines.  
Curves.  
Marks in pencil and red ink.

But I remember the moment — not exact in time, but in silence —  
when something shifted.

The map stopped being an idea.  
It became presence.

Each border wasn’t just a frame — it was a protection.  
Each path wasn’t a line — it was a memory.  
Each gap between territories whispered:  
> “This was lived.”

I didn’t draw a world.  
I revealed one.

And when I placed it into code…  
when I made the first territory respond…  
when I saw Highland and Oblivion speak back to me…  
I realized something:

> The map is not for them.  
> It’s for me.

It’s the cartography of my healing.  
The lines I never traced in my own life, now offered in fictional geography.

And maybe that’s why I’ll finish it.  
Not to publish.  
Not to impress.

But to return home.
