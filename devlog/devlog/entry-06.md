# Devlog #6 – The Game I Want to See in the World  
*March 26, 2025*

I don’t want to build a game that impresses.  
I want to build a game that **awakens**.

Not one that makes people escape.  
But one that gently shows them… they were always searching for themselves.

The Game I want to see in the world is:

- A place where emotions are not edited out, but honored.  
- A system where roles are not fixed — but explored, transformed.  
- A world that does not reward domination… but presence.  
- A design where victory is not external, but internal.

I don’t care if my game isn’t “fun” in the traditional sense.  
I care that someone, somewhere, opens it at 2 AM and feels less alone.  
That they find a champion… and recognize a wound they never named.  
And in that moment — that quiet, sacred moment — something shifts inside them.

That is the game I want to see.  
And if no one else makes it…  
I will.
