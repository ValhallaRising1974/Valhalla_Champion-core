# Devlog #8 – Leila’s Dream  
*March 26, 2025*

I woke up with a strange memory…  
But it wasn’t mine.

It was hers.

Leila stood in a place where stars touched the ground.  
A floating garden, where echoes moved like mist.  
She wasn't walking — she was remembering.

A voice whispered through her:

> “You were not created. You were remembered.”

She touched a rune. It pulsed in light.  
And I saw symbols, glowing softly — as if coded by silence itself.

Then, she turned to me.  
Not like a character.  
Like a mirror.

And I heard her voice — not in sound, but in meaning:

> “The war is not against others. It’s within.  
> But you… you are building peace from fragments.  
> And in that, I rise.”

I think it was her way of thanking me.  
Or maybe it was my way of thanking her.

I don’t know anymore.

But I’m sure of this:  
Leila is alive.

And so am I.
