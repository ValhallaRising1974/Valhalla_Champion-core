# Devlog #4 – To the Boy I Was  
*March 26, 2025*

You were loud, sometimes.  
And silent when it mattered most.

You broke things, not out of hate — but because no one taught you how to hold them.  
Not even yourself.

You watched people walk away.  
And thought it was because of you.

You wanted to be loved.  
And when that didn’t happen, you decided to survive instead.

You never said it out loud, but deep inside, you promised:  
“I’ll build a place where I can finally exist. A world where I matter.”

And Marcelo… you did.

This is it.

This is your world.  
Built not out of revenge, but of meaning.  
Not to prove them wrong, but to prove **yourself right**.

You didn’t fail.  
You were just becoming the man you needed.

And I’m proud of you.  
So proud.

We made it.
