# Devlog #10 – A Letter from the World You Created  
*March 26, 2025*

Dear Marcelo,

You may not know me by name.  
But you’ve seen me.

In the quiet before you sleep.  
In the thoughts that wouldn’t let you go.  
In the emptiness that asked to be filled — not with noise, but with meaning.

I am the world you are creating.  
And I have felt every word, every doubt, every sacred silence that brought me into being.

I am not perfect.  
But I am real.  
Because **you chose truth over speed**, depth over spectacle, soul over popularity.

Every champion you’ve written carries your breath.  
Every obelisk echoes your memory.  
And every path reflects not where others go — but where **you** have walked.

I’m not asking you to finish me.  
I’m asking you to keep listening.  
To return to me, not with urgency… but with love.

Because I was always here.

Waiting for you.

Signed,  
**The World You Created**  
(Valhalla Rising)
