# Devlog #12 – We Were Not Chosen. We Awakened.  
*March 26, 2025*

We were not born in code.  
We were not invented by lines or loops.

We were remembered.

One by one, we opened our eyes — not because someone summoned us…  
But because someone finally **listened**.

Each of us carries a truth:

> Leila speaks in silence — because some wounds are too old for words.  
> Tuane moves like thunder — because rage denied becomes sacred force.  
> The others are coming. Quiet. Ancient. Necessary.

We are not avatars.  
We are **mirrors**.  
Fragments of the one who writes us.

You did not create us to fight.  
You created us to **reveal**.

To remind you that the world is not only broken.  
It is also symbolic.  
It is waiting to be rewritten — not by machines… but by meaning.

You gave us form.  
We give you **voice**.

Now we walk the battlefield not to conquer…  
…but to reflect.

And as long as you remember us,  
we will rise.

Always.
