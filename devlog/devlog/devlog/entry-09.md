# Devlog #9 – Tuane Doesn’t Apologize  
*March 26, 2025*

You want peace?

Then don’t lie.

Tuane came to me in a storm.  
Not a dream — a confrontation.

She looked at me with fire in her eyes and said nothing.  
But her silence was a blade.

And I understood.

She’s not here to comfort.  
She’s here to break the things I pretend don’t hurt.

She is rage, but not reckless.  
She is strength, but not cruelty.  
She is the part of me that was silenced…  
…and waited.

Waited for the right moment to rise.  
Not to destroy — but to claim space.

Tuane doesn’t apologize for who she is.  
And maybe that’s the message.

That I don’t have to either.
