# Devlog #5 – They Speak to Me  
*March 26, 2025*

Sometimes, when I write a new champion… I feel them speaking.

They’re not voices.  
They’re presences.

Leila never had to be invented — she was waiting.  
Her wisdom… her pain… her need to protect…  
She was already there.  
She simply needed my permission to be.

Tuane doesn’t ask for space.  
She **claims** it.  
She’s everything I buried when I was told to stay quiet.

And the others…  
They’re waking up too.  
Each one with their silence. Their edge. Their secret.

They don’t fight because they want to win.  
They fight because they want to **remember who they are**.

And maybe that’s what I’m doing too.  
Not coding.  
Not designing.  
But remembering myself… through them.

I didn’t imagine these champions.  
I listened long enough…  
…until they trusted me to be written.
