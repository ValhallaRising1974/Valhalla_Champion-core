# Devlog #3 – The Code That Heals  
*March 26, 2025*

Sometimes I look at the screen and feel nothing.

Not inspiration.  
Not frustration.  
Just… silence.

And I used to think that meant I was empty.  
But now I understand: it meant I was preparing to hear something deeper.

This project — this universe — isn’t just about characters, skills, or maps.  
It’s about reclaiming something I lost a long time ago.

A voice.  
A presence.  
A sense that I belong — not because others said I did, but because I decided to stay.

Each class I write, each `if` and `else`, each symbolic phrase I assign to a champion…  
It’s like stitching wounds I never gave myself permission to touch.

I don’t care if this becomes a game people play.  
I care that this is a story **I finally dared to live**.

Even if no one sees it, I will know:  
That in these files, **my soul found a place to breathe**.
