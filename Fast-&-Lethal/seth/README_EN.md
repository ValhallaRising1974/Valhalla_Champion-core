# Seth – The Shadow Reaper 🗡️🌑

This repository contains all files related to the champion **Seth** from the *Valhalla Rising – The Parchment* universe. Seth is a stealth-based Slayer focused on true damage, high mobility, and deadly executions using his ultimate ability "Slaughter".

## 📜 Lore
Born from the shadows and shaped by madness, Seth was once an ordinary man. Now, he is a hungry entity, molded by pain and void. His body no longer belongs to him — it fused with his daggers, driven by silent fury. Only his sister, Emi, believes a trace of humanity still remains inside him.
