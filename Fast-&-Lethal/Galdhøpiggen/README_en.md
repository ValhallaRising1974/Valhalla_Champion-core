## Lore

Galdhøpiggen was exiled from his homeworld after committing an unthinkable act: the assassination of his own brother. While some called him a monster, others whispered of deeper truths—of manipulation, betrayal, and a fate he could not escape.

He is one of the few Slayers summoned by the astral deities Frey and Freya to the Valhalla Rising event—not for punishment, but for redemption. Every Slayer, including Galdhøpiggen, is offered the same path: one thousand justified victories to earn forgiveness and release from the thirst for violence.

Though ruthless in battle, Frey and Freya believe that Galdhøpiggen holds a buried nobility. Perhaps, in fighting for balance, he will rediscover the light long lost within him.

## Ultimate Ability

**"Wings of Judgment"**  
Galdhøpiggen marks a target anywhere on the map. If the mark is valid, he takes flight instantly and descends upon the enemy to execute them, no matter their location.
