**Galdhøpiggen – The Dragon of the Silent Mountain**
Origin: Planet Vanaheim – Realm of the Æsir gods

Svein Olsen was a humble farmer until Grotag, a dragon driven mad by grief, invaded Vanaheim and destroyed half the world, killing Svein’s wife and daughters. Svein awaited death with unwavering resolve, which awakened unexpected empathy in Grotag.

Before Grotag could consume him, Frey and Freya intervened. They offered Svein a chance to restore Vanaheim by joining the Valhalla Rising – The Parchment and defeating the Armageddon Inferno, the real source of Grotag’s madness.

Svein agreed and fused with Grotag, becoming Galdhøpiggen, named after Midgard’s highest mountain — a symbol of cosmic harmony and peace.

Now a Slayer of the Middleway, Galdhøpiggen floats in battle, swift and deadly.
