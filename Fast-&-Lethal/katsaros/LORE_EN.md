# Katsaros — The Shadow Slicer

Katsaros is neither man nor beast. He is an abomination from biblical hell, forged in the abyss of eternal damnation.

Once a demon of the underworld, Katsaros was condemned for crimes beyond reckoning. Escaping Lucifer’s grasp, he made a pact with Freya and Frey — gods of Valhalla — who granted him sanctuary in exchange for a tortured path toward redemption. But they knew that true forgiveness was never his to claim. What awaited Katsaros was an endless existence of suffering, trapped in an eternal loop of punishment until his essence withered into the void.

His crime? Katsaros murdered Seth’s family in cold blood — not out of wrath, but betrayal. He manipulated Seth into trusting him, made promises, then struck when the boy let down his guard. And yet, in the moment of death, he saw something in Seth’s eyes: a spark of light he had never encountered in all his years of darkness. It made him pause… but only for a moment.

Katsaros is no longer merely a demon. He is now a disfigured entity of dark matter, a shattered soul that possessed the body of a homeless man in his desperate search for redemption. He consumed the man’s soul in an attempt to escape his own suffering — a transformation that only deepened his torment. Now, he roams Valhalla like a walking shadow, searching for something he knows he will never find.

Freya and Frey accepted him, not in hope of salvation, but in belief that his punishment should be eternal. His fate? An immortal life in an endless loop of regret, betrayal, slaughter… and anguish.

Katsaros does not fight for glory. He is a silent presence, a slicer of flesh and spirit alike. Whatever humanity once lingered in him dissolves more with every step. He is doomed to wander, trapped in limbo until his existence vanishes into shadow.
