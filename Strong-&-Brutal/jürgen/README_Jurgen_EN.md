# ðŸ’€ JÃ¼rgen â€“ The Punk Skull Warrior | *Valhalla Rising: The Parchment* (EN)

JÃ¼rgen is an ancient being whose existence spans across ages and realities. Throughout his travels across the universe, he encountered many worlds â€” but it was the young and peaceful **Planet Astral** that captivated him. A highly evolved society full of harmony, love, and environmental balance... and within it, a young woman named **Freydis**.

Curious and touched by their way of life, JÃ¼rgen took a human form and watched from afar. Freydis stood out â€” a passionate athlete, reader, and fighter. He approached with care and humility, and she, drawn to his presence, welcomed him in. A powerful and unexpected love emerged.

Burdened by truth, JÃ¼rgen revealed his origins â€” immortal, far from her world. He believed their bond a mistake. But Freydis already knew who he truly was â€” not by name, but by soul. Nothing would keep her from his side.

At that moment, **Frey and Freya** appeared. They invited the couple to join *Valhalla Rising â€“ The Parchment*, giving Freydis the strength of a true warrior, and JÃ¼rgen the opportunity to fight for justice in his definitive form: a rebellious **punk skull fighter**, forged by countless battles across the stars.

Together, they now fight not only for balance â€” but for a love that defies time itself.
