## Lore

Freydis was born under the sign of strength and legacy. Her parents were renowned champions of opposing disciplines, and she inherited from them both precision and ferocity. Her older brother is a Warlock who chose the path of support and balance, but Freydis chose to fight on the frontlines, where she could let her rage dance with purpose.

Among the few who understand her flame is Jürgen, a fellow bruiser — ancient, noble, and cursed by time. He loves her, yet keeps distance, haunted by the thought of seeing her fall before him. Freydis, however, embraces life and battle with equal passion, unafraid of fate.
