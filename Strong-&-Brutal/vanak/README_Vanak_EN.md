# 🐂 Vanak – The Relentless Minotaur | *Valhalla Rising: The Parchment* (EN)

Vanak is a mutant from the war-torn planet Hariston. Born to Berna and Vauron, he was handed over to the Gladiator Council of Turdorion, the most corrupt city in his world. Raised in cruelty, Vanak was trained to suppress emotion and show no mercy.

During his first major tournament, he faced Muzak, a warrior broken by the death of his children. Vanak was ordered to kill, but seeing the grief in Muzak’s eyes, he refused. This act of compassion enraged his masters. At that moment, Frey and Freya intervened, recognizing the warrior's inner strength and invited him to join *Valhalla Rising – The Parchment*.

Vanak now fights not for blood, but for balance and redemption.
