## Lore

Megalodon is a mutated warrior from Nutrys, a world scorched by the radiation of three dying stars. Once a noble defender of his realm, he and his brother TigerShark were transformed by the unfiltered rays into hyper-aggressive fighters. Though their strength grew, so did their pain.

When Frey and Freya appeared before them with a divine offer—participation in Valhalla Rising in exchange for the salvation of their planet—Megalodon accepted. TigerShark, however, refused, unwilling to show weakness. The two fought in a sacred duel to decide: the one to immobilize the other in two minutes would determine their fate.

Megalodon emerged victorious. He entered the arena of Valhalla Rising, not only to fight, but to ensure that his world, Nutrys, would one day bloom again.
