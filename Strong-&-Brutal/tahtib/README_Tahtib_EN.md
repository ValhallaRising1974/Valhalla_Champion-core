# ⚔️ Tahtib – The Egyptian Storm Ninja | *Valhalla Rising: The Parchment* (EN)

Tahtib is a unique Bruiser who blends ancient Egyptian wisdom with Japanese Ninjutsu techniques. After a painful childhood on the planet El-Adwah — filled with prejudice, loss, and hardship — she was embraced by a kind family in Chongqing province. There, she became a renowned cook and Kugo harpist, winning over the local people.

When her new family was slaughtered by a brutal Slayer, Tahtib was saved by Frey and Freya, who offered her a chance to fight back. Trained by Balder, the warrior god of Asgard, she became a fast, unpredictable and powerful combatant. Her mission: to protect the innocent and restore justice to her world.
